Summary: Five Countries Where Over 80% of Children Live in Rural Areas

Mongolia
91% of primary age children live in rural areas. Only 9% are urban. Here, 4.33% of girls and 5.76% of boys are out of school. 
This is odd because in most places girls are more disadvantaged. Here, boys are slightly worse off. Rural doesn’t have to mean behind. 
Mongolia proves that. But we still need to ask why the pattern is reversed.

Central African Republic
87% rural. And the numbers hurt. 24.93% of girls are out of school versus only 5.51% of boys. This isn't just a gap. It's a chasm. Girls are kept home, 
deprived of the beauty of education, while boys are pushed forward. It's a quiet, systemic erasure of young girls' futures.

Panama
87% rural. Here, 9.49% of girls and 9.99% of boys are out of school. Almost equal suffering. No huge gender gap, just a system failing all its rural children. 
They should be in classrooms, savoring every moment of learning, not missing out together.

Nicaragua
84% rural. Again, near equal pain. 9.59% of girls and 9.91% of boys out of school. How can so many young children, especially girls, 
be out of school when they should be inside studying, enjoying every second of it? These aren't just statistics. They're lost childhoods.

Latvia
83% rural. 1.07% of girls are out of school. 1.80% of boys are out of school. This isn't about gender disparity. It's deeper. A system failing all children equally. Boys are 
nearly 70% more likely to be out of school. When there's no gender gap to blame, the problem becomes clearer. The entire structure needs attention. 
1.44% might sound small, but it's thousands of children whose place should be in a classroom. Rural Latvia isn't showing the catastrophic gaps of Central Africa, but it's whispering a warning. 
Even in better countries, the system is quietly leaving children behind.
